# Projects in C

This is my repository for projects written in C.

I am learning C on my own time to supplement what I am learning in school as well as for my own interest. 
I am just starting out learning, but am quickly feeling comfortable writing in C due to the similarities to other object-oriented languages I am learning such as Java and C#. I hope that learning C will give me a strong basis for continuing my education and being able to add C++ as well with ease. 

I am also learning how to write in ASM and will on occasion add inline ASM into my code to practice my
understanding of memory manipulation and storage.
